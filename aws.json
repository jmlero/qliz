    {
      "id": 1,
      "question": "A company needs to ensure that data stored in S3 is automatically transitioned to lower-cost storage after 90 days and deleted after 365 days. Which solution meets these requirements?",
      "options": [
        "Create an S3 Lifecycle policy with transition and expiration rules",
        "Use CloudWatch Events to trigger Lambda functions for object management",
        "Configure S3 Object Lock with retention periods",
        "Implement AWS DataSync for automated data archival"
      ],
      "correct_answer": 0,
      "explanation": "S3 Lifecycle policies allow you to define rules for automatic transition between storage classes and expiration (deletion) of objects based on age."
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "question": "An application running on EC2 instances needs to access DynamoDB tables. What is the most secure way to grant permissions?",
      "options": [
        "Store IAM user credentials in the application configuration file",
        "Attach an IAM role to the EC2 instances with DynamoDB permissions",

        "Hard-code access keys in the application code"
      ],
      "correct_answer": 1,
      "explanation": "IAM roles provide temporary credentials that are automatically rotated. Attaching a role to EC2 instances is the most secure method as it avoids storing long-term credentials."
    },
    {
      "id": 3,
      "question": "A web application experiences unpredictable traffic spikes. Which combination of AWS services provides the most cost-effective auto-scaling solution?",

        "CloudFront + EC2 instances with fixed capacity"
      ],
      "correct_answer": 0,
      "explanation": "An Application Load Balancer with EC2 Auto Scaling using target tracking policies automatically adjusts capacity based on actual demand, optimizing both performance and cost for unpredictable workloads."
    },
    {
      "id": 4,
      "question": "A Solutions Architect needs to design a highly available architecture across multiple Availability Zones. The RDS database must support automatic failover. Which option should be used?",

        "RDS Multi-AZ deployment",
        "EC2 instances with database replication",
        "DynamoDB Global Tables"
      ],
      "correct_answer": 1,
      "explanation": "RDS Multi-AZ automatically provisions and maintains a synchronous standby replica in a different AZ, providing automatic failover capability for high availability."

        "AWS PrivateLink",
        "Security Groups attached to S3 buckets"
      ],
      "correct_answer": 1,
      "explanation": "VPC Endpoints for S3 allow you to privately connect your VPC to S3 without using an internet gateway, and you can use bucket policies to restrict access to specific VPC endpoints."
    },
    {
      "id": 6,
      "question": "An application requires a shared file system accessible from multiple EC2 instances across different AZs with NFS protocol support. Which service should be used?",

    {
      "id": 7,
      "question": "A company needs to analyze application logs stored in S3 using SQL queries without setting up infrastructure. Which service combination is most appropriate?",
      "options": [
        "Amazon EMR + Apache Spark",
        "Amazon Athena + AWS Glue Data Catalog",
        "Amazon Redshift + COPY command",

        "Enable RDS encryption at rest",
        "Use SSL/TLS certificates to connect to the RDS instance",
        "Enable VPC Flow Logs",
        "Configure AWS KMS encryption keys"
      ],
      "correct_answer": 1,
      "explanation": "To encrypt data in transit to RDS, you must use SSL/TLS connections. RDS supports SSL/TLS, and you can enforce encrypted connections using parameter groups and connecting with SSL certificates."
    },
    {
      "id": 10,
      "question": "A web application uses ALB to distribute traffic to EC2 instances. Some users report intermittent connection failures. CloudWatch metrics show healthy targets. What could be the cause?",
      "options": [
        "ALB security group is not allowing outbound traffic",
        "Target instances' security group doesn't allow traffic from ALB security group",
        "ALB is not in the same Availability Zone as the targets",
        "Health check interval is too long"
      ],
      "correct_answer": 1,
      "explanation": "Even if targets are healthy, if the target instances' security group doesn't allow inbound traffic from the ALB's security group on the application port, connections will fail. This is a common misconfiguration."
